# OverLoader

This is a tool designed to make the debug cycle of KusOS faster. It was created from the KusOS source code (specifically ExoSkye/KusOS@8a8ceb263a1f262ecc1843f8b8b36e4ee71f53de ) but slimmed down significantly

## (Planned) Features

- Load a kernel over Serial
- Take commands from Serial
- Other stuff??

Heavily WIP
